Glyph-a-Day webfont icons
=========================

A bit fed up with the speed in which the font-awesome fonts are updated (not that I blame Dave, he probably has a day-job too) I decided that things could be done differently. Font-awesome is currently, when it comes down to the design of the icons itself, a one man effort. I just think a good iconset could be community driven, where any number of designers can add useful icons to the set. Curated and supervised perhaps, but just let's see what happens.

Setting up
----------
I am currently looking into setting up a github repository which could cater such a community. You are now looking at that setup, which is a work in progress. In order for this project to succeed it should be possible to go from design to @font-face embed in one simple workflow. So let's set up that workflow, right here!

Wanna join?
